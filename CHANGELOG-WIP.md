# Release Notes for Craft CMS 5.5 (WIP)

### Content Management
- Improved the styling of element cards with thumbnails. ([#15692](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/15692), [#15673](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/15673))
- Elements within element selection inputs now have “Replace” actions.

- Address index tables can now include “Country” columns.
- Action button cells within editable tables are now center-aligned vertically.
- Dropdown cells within editable tables are no longer center-aligned. ([#15742](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/15742))

- Pressing <kbd>Return</kbd> when an inline-editable field is focused now submits the inline form. (Previously <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Command</kbd> had to be pressed as well.) ([#15841](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/15841))
