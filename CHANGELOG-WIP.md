# Release Notes for Craft CMS 5.5 (WIP)

### Content Management
- When saving a nested element within a Matrix/Addresses field in card view, the changes are now saved to a draft of the owner element, rather than published immediately. ([#16002](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/16002))
- Nested element cards now show status indicators if they are new or contain unpublished changes. ([#16002](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/16002))
- Improved the styling of element cards with thumbnails. ([#15692](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/15692), [#15673](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/15673))
- Elements within element selection inputs now have “Replace” actions.

- Address index tables can now include “Country” columns.
- Action button cells within editable tables are now center-aligned vertically.
- Dropdown cells within editable tables are no longer center-aligned. ([#15742](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/15742))
- Link fields marked as translatable now swap the selected element with the localized version when their value is getting propagated to a new site for a freshly-created element. ([#15821](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/15821))
- Pressing <kbd>Return</kbd> when an inline-editable field is focused now submits the inline form. (Previously <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>/<kbd>Command</kbd> had to be pressed as well.) ([#15841](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/15841))
