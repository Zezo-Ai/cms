# Release notes for Craft CMS 4.14 (WIP)

## Content Management
- The global sidebar no longer shows “Failed” for queue jobs, for users that don’t have access to the Queue Manager. ([#16184](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/16184))

## Administration
- Added the `elements/delete-all-of-type` command. ([#16423](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/16423))
- Added the `utils/delete-empty-volume-folders` command. ([#16388](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/issues/16388))
- The Queue Manager utility now shows jobs’ class names. ([#16228](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/16228)) 

## Development
- Added the `primarySite` global Twig variable. ([#16370](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/discussions/16370))
- The `duration` Twig filter now has a `language` argument. ([#16332](https://github.com/craftcms/cms/pull/16332))
